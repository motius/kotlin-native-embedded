# kotlin-native-embedded
Dockerfile for compiling Kotlin/Native for Zephyr embedded targets

## What is this all about?

Our goal is to push Kotlin/Native as a new developer platform for embedded development! For this we have decided to build a toolchain for everyday development, which is similar to what we have at Motius for other projects as well.


## What's next? 

* Pushing this Dockerfile to the Docker Hub
* Publishing a CI file for building for Zephyr targets with this Docker image
* Add more Zephyr targets to Kotlin/Native.
